# Problem 5
Create an **abstract class Employee** with the member variables **name**, **address** and **number** with their corresponding getter and setter methods. This class has a constructor that initializes the member variables. It also has two methods **computePay()** that return the pay to an employee and **mailCheck()** that sends the cheque to the corresponding address of the employee. Create a class **Salary** that inherits the Employee class and contains a member salary along with getter and setter methods. Create a driver class that initializes two employees one with Salary reference and the other with Employee reference and invoke the **mailCheck()** method by using both the references.
