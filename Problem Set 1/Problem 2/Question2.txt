Problem No. 2:
Create a class to hold data about a high school sports team. 
The Team class holds data fields for high school name (such as Roosevelt High), sport (such as Girlsâ€™  Basketball),  and  team  name  (such  as  Dolphins).  
Include  a  constructor  that takes parameters for each field, and include get methods that return the values  of  the  fields.  
Also  include  a  public  static  String  named  MOTTO  and  initialize  it  to  Sportsmanship!.  
Write  an  application  named  TestTeam  to  instantiate  three  Team  objects  with  different  values,  and  then  display  all  the  data,  including  the  motto,  for  each  object.  
Save  both  the  Team.cpp and TestTeam.cpp files.Team.cpp:
