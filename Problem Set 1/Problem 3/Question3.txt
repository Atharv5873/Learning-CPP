Problem No. 3:
A) Create a FitnessTracker class that includes data fields for a fitness activity, the  number  of  minutes  spent  participating,  and  the  date.  
The  class  includes  methods  to  get  each  field.  
In  addition,  create  a  default  constructor  that  automatically  sets  the  activity  to  running,  the  minutes  to  0,  and  the  date  to  January 1 of the current year. 
Save the file as FitnessTracker.cpp. Create an application  that  demonstrates  each  method  works  correctly,  and  save  it  as  TestFitnessTracker.cpp.

B)  Create  an  additional  overloaded  constructor  for  the  FitnessTracker  class  you created in Exercise 3a. This constructor receives parameters for each of the data fields and assigns them appropriately. 
Add any needed statements to the TestFitnessTracker application to ensure that the overloadedConstructor works correctly, save it, and then test it FitnessTracker.cpp:
