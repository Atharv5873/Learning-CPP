Problem No. 4:
A) Create a class named BloodData that includes fields that hold a blood type(the four blood types are O, A, B, and AB) and an Rh factor (the factors are 1 and â€“).  
Create  a  default  constructor  that  sets  the  fields  to  O  and  1,  and an overloaded constructor that requires values for both fields. Include get and set methods for each field. Save this file as BloodData.cpp. Create an application named TestBloodData that demonstrates each method works correctly.
Save the application as TestBloodData.cpp. BloodData.cpp: 

B) Create  a  class  named  Patient  that  includes  an  ID  number,  age,  andBloodData. 
Provide a default constructor that sets the ID number to 0, the ageto 0, and the BloodData values to O and 1.
Create an overloaded constructorthat provides values for each field. Also provide get methods for each field.
